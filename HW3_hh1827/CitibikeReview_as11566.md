**Review Author**: Anupama Santhosh

### Verify the null and alternative hypotheses
The null hypothesis is stated correctly with clarity. Normalization has been done and fractions have been used in the Null hypothesis statement. 

The alternative hypothesis is missing, so that should be added as the inverse of the null hypothesis (i.e. instead of <= use >).

The time frame is defined and the significance level is also stated.

### Verify that the data supports the project

Data chosen supports the project. Although no analyses have been done looking at the fraction of men and women riders at night time, which forms the basis of the hypothesis.

### Choose an appropriate test
Chi-Square test should be ideal as the test deals with comparing categorical variable gender
