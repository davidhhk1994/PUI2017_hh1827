Hongkai's graph shows the relationship between greenhouse gas emission and  energy use intensity, showing a clear positive correlation. 
The colors are well chosen, and the scale of the axis seems appropriate for the range of data displayed. The graph could be improved by
the addition of a caption, describing any particular trends or outliers to look out for when interpreting the graph. Additionally, the 
legend could be colored differently or given a border, as at first glance the blue dot that represents observations appears to be a data
point itself. 

Overall, the clearly portrays the relationship between EUI and GHG emissions.
